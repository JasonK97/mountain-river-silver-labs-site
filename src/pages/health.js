      <h3>Why do we remove Dewclaws?</h3>
      <p>
        Dewclaws are like the thumb of a dog's front paws. Within 3 days of being born, 
        we use _______ a numbing cream and some surgical scissors to clip the dewclaw off.
        <br /><br />
        Dewclaws serve no purpose other than getting in the way â€” they snag on carpets, 
        they get caught on toys or furniture, and so on. Better to have it removed cleanly 
        than to have your dog accidentally rip a dewclaw off, causing him unnecessary pain 
        and risking infection.

      <h3>Deworming</h3>
      <p>
        Every ______ amount of time, we give each puppy the dewormer to ensure that they 
        do not risk getting any worms during the course of their time before adoption with 
        us.
        <br /><br />
        Puppies are susceptible to intestinal parasites which can include roundworms, 
        hookworms, tapeworms, and whipworms. Deworming your pet will assist in the prevention 
        of illnesses caused by these intestinal parasites.
