        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Mountain River Silver Labs are silver factored Laborador Retrievers, we breed our
          black female, Kimber Mountain of Steel. She is a silver factored Lab, which means that
          she has the potential to have black, charcoal, brown, and silver puppies each time she 
          has a litter with a Silver Lab stud. The stud we have been using has moved and so we are 
          currently in the search for another Silver stud that is not related to Kimber.

            <p className='content-left'>
              Kimber is a three year old silver factored AKC black lab and is the mother 
              to all of our litters.  Her father was a silver lab and her mother was a 
              yellow lab. She is 90lbs. Kimber loves children and other animals. She is 
              has a very active personality but is also gentle. She will play fetch all 
              day long and has a very athletic body and personality. She is a fantastic 
              family dog and loves to go on adventures. Kimber has had two litters and 
              is a wonderful mother to her puppies. All of her puppies are silver factored 
              puppies which means even if the puppy isnâ€™t silver it has the possibility 
              to have silver puppies.

              Silver Duke 2 is a beautiful silver lab stud that we have used for our past two 
              litters. He has a very shiny coat and has an athletic body type making him a 
              fantastic hunting partner that he will pass onto his pups. He is 85lbs and enjoys 
              being with his family. All of his puppies are silver factored puppies and wonderful 
              companions.
